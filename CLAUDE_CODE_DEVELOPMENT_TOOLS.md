## üîÑ **Integration with Unified Software Manager**

### Adding Tools to Management
```bash
# Edit tools.yaml to add new tools
vim monitoring-configs/tools.yaml

# Example entry for a new tool:
eza:
  current_version: "0.15.0"
  github_repo: "eza-community/eza"
  update_method: "binary_download"
  category: "cli"
  priority: "medium"
```

### Monitoring Strategy
- **Command-line tools**: Managed via `tools.yaml` with binary_download
- **Language-specific tools**: Managed via version managers (nvm, pyenv, etc.)
- **Editor plugins**: Managed within respective editors

## üöÄ **Quick Start Commands**

### Essential Setup
```bash
# Install the unified software manager first
./unified-software-manager-manager.sh

# Then add priority tools to tools.yaml and run updates
./version-checker.sh --check-all

# Install version managers for language-specific tools
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

### Verification
```bash
# Test the tools
eza -la --icons
zoxide query --list
httpie --version
starship --version
```
